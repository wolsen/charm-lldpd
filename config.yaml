  i40e-lldp-stop:

       This allows control over Intel's i40e NIC driver. By default
       i40e blocks userspace LLDP and does it on its own. Setting this
       option to 'True' means charm will disable this functionality in
       the NIC and do it within userspace.
  interfaces-regex:
    type: string
    default: 
    description: |
       Which interfaces should lldpd announce details. If you want lldpd
       to listen on multiple interfaces, set it here. Examples:

       seth*,meth*

       You can also use exclamation mark to exclude an interface:

       eth*,!eth1

       This way lldpd will listen on all eth* interfaces with an
       exception of eth1.

       By default this is set to None, which puts lldpd in listening
       mode only.
  systemid-from-interface:
    type: string
    default: 
    description: Pull systemID from this interface
  enable-snmp:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: Enable the SNMP agent for LLDPD
  short-name:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: Set short name in SysName instead of FQDN
